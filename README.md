## Project 1
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the abilities of a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, particularly Deep Q-Learning. The project uses Unity environment, a game development framework and Pytorch, a deep learning framework, to train an agent to solve an environment consisting of 37 continuous states and 4 actions. The goal of the agent is to maximize expected cumulative reward by collecting only yellow banana's (+1 reward) and avoiding blue banana's (-1 reward).
